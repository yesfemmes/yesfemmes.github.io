<div class="story full">
<p>June asks what is my earliest memory<br>
June, a beautiful memory in himself<br>
we share the magic of friends who’ve seen each other<br>
bourne each other<br>
through difficult times</p>
 
<p>He helped me begin counting my new life<br>
with a next-day sore asshole<br>
and a talk through Chicago cold<br>
that I’ll never forget<br>
Fingertips frozen<br>
going to pick up his truck<br>
the morning after a party<br>
from which Paige would begin<br>
to not speak to me</p>

<p>We discuss break-ups, our natures, the future<br>
How I want to be a friend and a lover<br>
never again a partner<br>
What I now, since that breach,<br>
that then recent death<br>
want family to look like for me</p>

<p>We are all dancing in June and Marc’s living room<br>
an after party party and everything was poured out<br>
The semester, my first in graduate school<br>
ended<br>
and dancing with Paige<br>
our oldest and best mode together<br>
Despite the now six months of not being together<br>
or because of it, flirting<br>
In the kitchen, June<br>
Maybe getting water from the sink<br>
practical even in his woozy state<br>
wears a white button-down<br>
billowy, untucked<br>
His chest unbound<br>
apparent, loose under the shirt<br>
sexy<br>
having had my share of liberal outpourings<br>
I walk right up to him<br>
and put my hands up inside his shirt</p>

<p>We must’ve gone to his bed before the party cleared<br>
At some point the phrase<br>
“kid in a candy shop” <br>
passes through my mind<br>
I choose a little one<br>
can’t remember the color<br>
and just like that have my first anal sex</p>

<p>In the morning<br>
Marc is texting June to come for brunch<br>
and June is texting “I am about to”<br>
which he is<br>
my fingers around his sizable clit<br>
“that’s what T will do for ya” <br>
he says</p>

<p>By the time our headaches set in<br>
we know we have misbehaved<br>
June is a friend of Paige too<br>
and there was my flirting with her<br>
and Marc trying to get her into a cab<br>
 without looking for me in June’s room… <br>
all in all we had been shitty friends to her. </p>

<p>Still somehow it was the catalyst she needed<br>
 to make the murky territory of our breakup<br>
into stone cold non-communication till May<br>
“Just let me graduate.” <br>
She had said<br>
and I was obedient<br>
if not extreme<br>
in carrying out her request.</p>

<p>But that day<br>
accompanied by guilt and post-sex malaise<br>
the two of us, June and myself were just kids<br>
figuring out what we wanted from this cold planet.</p>

<p>We’d be buddies now<br>
always moving furniture together<br>
showing up again and again without obligation<br>
Long drives and mix cds<br>
discussing class issues<br>
types of hotties<br>
loving love and loving words<br>
these things filled our errands with exuberance<br>
and our friendship with the taste of youth.</p>

<p>A few months ago he was staying at my house<br>
talking in the kitchen about how tricky it can be<br>
finding a place for work in a life built on love<br>
as we dried the dishes. <br>
I think he was glad to be in Chicago for his work<br>
away from his happy relationship<br>
and the pressure of being someone’s everything<br> 
for a moment.</p>

<p>We praised each other then got shy<br>
Halting in the hallway before heading to the couch he said—<br> 
as if there were more to say<br>
 “I always feel seventeen with you.”</p>
