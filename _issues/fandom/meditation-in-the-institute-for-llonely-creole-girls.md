        <p>So I got a grant. The Institute for Lonely Girls. I named this that. This is an institute for lonely girls.<br>
Why are we so lonely?<br>
Have you ever heard&mdash;creoles only like creoles? I heard that quote in the Spike Lee film When the Levee Breaks and I really attached to it.</p>

        
<p style="text-align: center;">I take my own hand and dance in a circle.<br>
Can brown bourgeois boys love only brown bourgeois boys?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I take my own hand and look in the mirror. I am circling and circling and circling my own tale.</p>

<p>Have you ever considered that the Book of Genesis is the story of an Abrahamic God on a shame spiral who wanted to repent? Why ELSE all this attention on repentance. Mistakes are part of the fibre of motivation. Or at least I was baptized this way.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I am manically dancing and singing.</p> 

<p style="text-align: center;">Who do I pray to?</p>

<p>Those that see the god that rules the color see the color.<br>
Oh&mdash;fuck Aphrodite! Goddesses of Kano, Ogun <br>
turning Hades, churning underwater heat&mdash;I am reminded<br>
that there are two Aphrodites anyway, one the Venus from<br>
the lips of the waves, the other sullen, on earth,<br> 
giving blow jobs for cigarettes; covered in soil. Beauty<br> 
is not the point here. That flame is relational.</p>

<p>I could make this Institute for Lonely Girls.<br> 
I could make this sadness an island.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to ball all my self-hatred and regret into my work. All the making and unmaking and anxiety&mdash;I’m just going to make something that’s not myself. Like this institute. And my bed. I’m going to make my bed. I could lie in it.</p>

<p>There’s a Sex and the City episode where Carrie is broken up with on a post-it and then goes to a club called Bed. It’s smokey and gauzy and everyone’s lying on beds in full make-up which really makes me wonder about the sheets. Like that whole wiped off face off makeup on the sheets question.</p>
<p>Well anyway she goes there and she meets her new ex’s friends there, also lounging and makes a fool of herself there.</p>

<p>See? I say that to prove something about the meaning of the bed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">In meditation, clasp the hands and imagine<br>
white light moving from the top of the skull<br>
and down the spine. Light two candles walk between<br>
them, and the absorbed worries of the days will disperse.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;">I want to make something else.<br>
Let my worries disperse.</p>

<p>I tried to do a meditation called Interdimensional Connectedness. It made me feel hungover, plus all I could see was Carrie Bradshaw on that stupid bed with that post-it. This was a Youtube video, obviously, BECAUSE HOW ELSE DO I DO A CONNECTEDNESS MEDITATION&mdash;from my own head? from leaving my own bed? All the comments were things like</p>

think about it guys. if it’s your multidimensional self, it’s doing the exact same thing but in a different reality. So while you’re trying to connect with them they are all trying to connect with you, and I also just sent this message to all of them in a different reality layout.</p>

<p><strong>GenXer82 GenXer82</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 year ago<br>Within just 5 minutes, I was at the place where all dimensions of the universe intersect with
each other. I call it: Planes crossing. Since all dimensional planes met. An amazing meditation<br>
magnetic minds. Keep up the good work</p>

Best experience yet!! Felt like I was gliding along different planes, moving in all
sorts of directions, letting my soul (and 3rd eye) guide me along the way. I actually ended up
listening to the “entire” 1.5 hours of the video!! :-)</p>



 <p style="text-align: center;">I like to imagine myself in parallel universes.<br>
But In all universes I must be running towards the same trouble.<br>
In all universes reaching out to ask myself with is real.</p>
