bio: |
  Called an "interdisciplinary gospel immortalist" by Kembra Pfahler of the Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black, Tyler Matthew Oyer is an artist, writer, organizer, and educator based in Los Angeles.  By researching diverse modalities of activism (ACT UP, ridiculous/queer theatre, Brechtian theatre, surrealism, underground cabaret, and punk) his performance works generate an intergenerational dialogue around politics, seeking new ways of articulating the connection between various systems of oppression between the past and the present in an attempt to grapple with our collective political future.

    <div class="text-wrapper"><p>CALLING ALL DIVAS: BATMAN DRACULA (2017) is a reenactment of Andy Warhol and Jack Smith’s unfinished collaborative film of the same title from 1964. Overlaying original footage (sourced from YouTube) with new footage shot in my garden, the dreamlike images become visuals for the soundtrack of Klaus Nomi’s live performance of Henry Purcell’s “Cold Song” from 1982 (also sourced from YouTube). In this new music video format, Smith’s cape (in my impersonation of Smith) has been decorated with the motifs of Steven Arnold’s iconic photographs. As a work of performance, Warhol, Smith, Nomi, Purcell, Arnold, and King Arthur become overlapping audio and visual references collapsing in time, space, and interweaving narratives within the framework of my desire to locate queer lineage.</p>
    <p>In the spirit of Kembra Pfahler’s working methodology availabism, I use the
materials that are available to me: things that are Google-able and
downloadable. The resulting forced collaborations may be inspirational or
irresponsible paradoxes of the impossible and possible, dancing between
material and magical realisms. I can never ask these collaborators for permission
so is it even collaboration? Is it fandom? What are the rules to fandom? Idol
worship? Obsession!? Where does fan art fall on the spectrum between teenage
fantasies and museum collections? Is this an anti-method of archiving? Concepts
of legitimization dissolve, mutate, or behave in the most idiosyncratic ways.</p>
    <p>Age, time, disease, distance, finances, governments, languages, and ability are a few of many factors that can hinder individuals from meeting. In CALLING ALL DIVAS, I investigate, converse, collaborate, and fantasize with persona,
costume, text, movement and music to create chapters that focus specifically on
queer inspiration. By imitating, honoring, listening, and conjuring people and
characters, my body becomes a site of devastation and possibility. I momentarily
experience something I can never fully realized or become something I can never
fully be. This is actual and symbolic. It is a reminder that the self is a concept to explore endlessly if one so desires. Invent, reinvent, actively dislocating and
relocating. As José Esteban Muñoz reminds us, queerness is a becoming, an
ideality, a horizon to look toward not a location to reach.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable as simple homage, the references in CALLING ALL DIVAS are
looked to as material to learn from and with, alongside or through. Queerness
maintains a distance from heteronormative temporalities as active critique, a
behavior that transcends the specificities of history. While Warhol, Smith, Purcell, Arnold, and Nomi employed diverse creativities and criticalities in past times with different historical demands, aspects of their work, with reconsideration, still generate newness, exigencies, and potency today.</p>
<p>CALLING ALL DIVAS becomes a living archival method; not assembled
according to conventional notions of historical institutionality. The references are political figures: feminist, queer, HIV+, POC, movement leaders, revolutionaries, academics, artists… the chapters continue to compound.</p>
<p>Deviant in the face of product-oriented economic logics, this project does not
intend to draw conclusions, state facts, or conclude any kinds of clear theses. It
engages activities that probably seem pointless, wasteful, or unproductive to
those stranded in heternormative temporalities. Rather, queers, women, people
of color, frustrated heteros, those marginalized can find an invigorating essence
to take beyond the dominant prescribed methods of identification and inheritance
in the face of violence, oppression, erasure and loss.</p>
