<div class="text-wrapper"><p>New Sound Karaoke auteurs Bobby Service and Black Waterfall are perhaps the world's most beloved karaoke hosts. Happily married and deeply heterosexual&mdash;with a strong stress on the sexual&mdash;they have produced and directed an epic body of music videos documenting the most intimate, joyous, and painful moments in their life story, including their fated meeting at a vogueing competition at Prismz nightclub, their conversion to blessed heterosexuality, and their subsequent descent into the sexual underworld of whips, chains, and ball gags. Where will you find a more heart-wrenching and moving human drama in karaoke form?</p>
