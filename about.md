    <p>YES FEMMES is an online experiment that publishes writing and digital projects working toward a femme aesthetic. We're interested in <span class="highlight-pink">writing that explores the limits of the body,</span> that's campy or fannish, that engages with witchcraft or the occult, that has an excess of feeling, that looks to animals and plants as models or collaborators, <span class="highlight-yellow">that considers how digitality might be femme,</span> and that moves toward the horizon of queerness. We plan to publish irregularly, according to our feelings, the cycles of the moon, and other factors.</p>

    <p>YES FEMMES was conceived of first as a reading series by Sam Cohen and Gina Abelkop, while they were <span class="highlight-green">floating together in the ocean</span> off the coast of a Malibu beach. Its digital iteration is made in northeast Los Angeles, edited by Sam Cohen and designed by Sandra Rosales.</p>
