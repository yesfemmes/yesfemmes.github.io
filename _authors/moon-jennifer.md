Jennifer Moon is a Los Angeles based artist, adventurer, and revolutionary committed to creating alternatives to the predetermined outcomes of art and of life. Drawing from the extremely personal, blending a mix of political theory, science, self-help, popular culture, and fantasy, Moon presents possibilities of new futures and new ways of being that stimulate continuous expansion for all on this earth and beyond. Moon has exhibited at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, for Made in L.A. 2014 where she won the Mohn Public Recognition Award. She has had solo exhibitions at Commonwealth & Council, Los Angeles; Equitable Vitrines, Los Angeles; Transmission Gallery, Glasgow, Scotland; China Art Objects Galleries, Los Angeles; Richard Heller Gallery, Los Angeles; and Tunnel, New York. Moon also maintains a monthly radio show, Adventures With You, formerly Adventures Within, on KCHUNG and is the recipient of a 2013 CCF Fellowship for Visual Artists.
